# Dynamic ArrayA dynamic array is capable of grow and shrink in size. On the other hand, Static arrays are fixed sized and unable to grow or shrink in size.## How can we implement a Dynamic Array?### One way is to use a ***static array!***1.	Create a static array with an initial capacity.2.	Add elements to the static array, keeping track of the number of elements.3.	If adding another element exceed the capacity, then create a new static array with twice the capacity and copy the original elements in to that newly created array with the twice the number of capacity. :)
